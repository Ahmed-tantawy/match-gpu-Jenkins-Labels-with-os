Jenkins labels vs consistency check. I have found out that some workstations had wrong gpu labels. 
We need some script which will monitor the jenkins label AND the hw on the machine and based on it would WARN us that labels do not match... 
e.g. not enough GPU memory for given label, or label missing for ram_high or GPU etc.. Whoever picks this one, ping me
